#This file is a configuration file for the script create_imagevm.
#If you want to use it, you have to launch the said script this way:
#create_imagevm -c <path/to/this/file>.

#Make sure to read what follows carefully, and fill every field appropriately

#This field concerns the archicture of the docker image/virtual disk that
#will be created. It can either be amd64 or i386.
ARCHITECTURE : amd64

#Type of the thing you want to create. You can either create a docker image
#or a virtual disk image. Thus, the values you can put in the field TYPE are :
# - image
# - vm
#** This field must be filled ! **
TYPE : image

#This field allows you to specify what kind of virtual disk/docker image
#you want to create, or a list of dockerfiles you want to apply.
#BRANCH must take one of these values : debian, cosy, buildeb, kernel, minimal,
#repo, jenkins-slave, without-recommends, custom. (For more information
#use create_imagevm -h). If you choose custom, then you have to give us the
#list of dockerfiles you want to apply to the base image. Here is the list
#of the dockerfiles provided with this script : clean, install-extrapackages,
#remove-packages, with-buildeb, with-cosy, with-jenkins-slave, with-kernel,
#with-minimal, without-recommends, with-repo. You can use your own dockerfiles
#if you want. You just have to make sure that every dockerfile you want to use
#is located in the directory DOCKERFILESDIRECTORY. (use create_imagevm -h for
#more informations). 
#If you use custom, it means that you want to choose what are the dockerfiles
#that will be executed.
#The syntax for the value custom is different from the others because you have
#to tell us what are the dockerfiles you want to use. You have to use one these
#three syntax :
#
#BRANCH : custom dockerfile1 dockerfile2 ... | BRANCH :
#------------------------------------------- |   - custom  
#BRANCH :                                    |   - dockerfile1
#  - custom : dockerfile1 dockerfile2 ...    |   - dockerfile2
#                                            |   - ...
#
# The dockerfiles will be executed in the same order you put them, so be 
#careful.
BRANCH : custom with-minimal

#This field allows you to choose where the dockerfiles are located.
DOCKERFILESDIRECTORY : ./dockerfiles/

EXTRAPACKAGES :

#This field allows you to choose if temporary files/images will be removed.
